# My First HTML

Work with your group to implement the following:

## Instructions

 In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:

* DOCTYPE declaration
* Head tag with a title tag
* H1 tag with a title of your choice
* Embed an image
* Create the following three links on your page:
  * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
  * Make the second link bold.
  * Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.

* HINT: You should be looking up at the screen pretty often :P

  * Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
  * Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
  * Create a table with 2 columns (animal class and animal name) and 4 rows of animals.
  * Embed a Youtube video of your favorite band/musician.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) to research this if you get stuck.
